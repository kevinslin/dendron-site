Dendron gives you the ability to do a full text search of your notes. Most queries can be satisfied using [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]] but depending on the use case, sometimes searching is more useful. 

We leverage VSCode [builtin search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_search-across-files) capabilities to do full text search.
