>  Once you start using Dendron you never look back. Saving all the files in one folder is incredibly liberating, fast and efficient. Try it for a few days and you will see. Getting your thoughts and information down into a hierarchy is so quick and easy. I am loving the experience. (I have only been using Dendron for a few days now. And it is a game changer for me. CTL + L is your friend.)
