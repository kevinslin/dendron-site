- visit [nodes.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download node for windows
- verify that node is available in vscode by opening the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and running `node --version`
    - you should see a version number printed out
- if you see `command not found`, you might need to restart before
