## Pre-requisites

This walkthrough will help you get started with Dendron. Before you start, make sure you have Dendron installed. If not, you can do so by following the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.install]].

### Your first workspace

After you've started Dendron, you should see a screen like the one below (depending on your color theme, your color theme might look different).
