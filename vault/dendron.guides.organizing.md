## Hierarchies
- primary author: [Ben Vautier](https://github.com/Orcomp) 

We all have different interests, objectives and personalities, so it is important to build hierarchies that are "fit for purpose" and capture what is important to **you** (Don't copy other peoples hierarchies blindly. Understand the principles behind them, but build your own from scratch.)

1. Write down all the things that matter to you. Your interests, hobbies, objectives, roles (at work, at home, with friends), contexts etc... (Suggesting the right things to think about is important. Will need to refine this.)
2. Agree on the best words to use and their meaning. (Being consistent with the words you use in your hierarchies is important. The meaning we associate with words will change over time, and we might find new words that are more precise. That is fine, Dendron can refactor all that, but we still need to keep track of what words mean to us and how that evolves over time. Too often our meaning is different to others, which results in a lot of confusion and frustration.)
3. Use precise words. Be wary of words that can have multiple meanings depending on the context.
4. Start small. Learn how to use Dendron to expand hierarchies as needed. Once your hierarchies expand and mature, compare them with others just to make sure you haven't missed anything. (However doing this too soon could be detrimental. Doing it at the right time could be extremely fruitful)
  
- The problem with a lot of PKM systems (IMHO) is that they leave too much to chance .(Some like to call it serendipity). People think about "tags" on the fly. They have never really thought about what matters to them, and "why" it matters. Neither have they spent the time to choose the right words, and define them. Which means the words they use for tags changes with their mood, priorities or environment. Trying to link all that after the fact is nearly futile.
