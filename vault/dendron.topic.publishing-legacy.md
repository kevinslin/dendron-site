Dendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. Notes are published under the [dendron-jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). 

You can find documentation about the theme [[here|dendron.pro.dendron-jekyll]]

- NOTE: Jekyll based publishing is now DEPRECATED. We encourage everyone to move to [[Publishing V2|dendron.topic.publishing]]
