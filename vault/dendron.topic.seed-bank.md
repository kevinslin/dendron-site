The Dendron Seed Bank is a registry of public vaults that you can add to your workspace. At this time, we are launching with two vaults in the seed bank:

- dendron-site: this mirrors the content from <http://dendron.so/>
- aws: this mirrors the content from <http://aws.dendron.so/>

The vision for the seed bank is to create a repository of open source vaults that provide both notes and schemas for all the things that people care about.

## Requesting a Vault

We are planning on adding many more vaults to this registry over time. To help us prioritize, we've 
created the [Seed Request Template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=seed-request.md&title=) on GitHub so you can request new subjects you want to see in the seed bank.

## Submitting a Vault

If you have a vault that you think would make a good addition to the seed bank, you can submit a vault by following the instructions below:

1. make sure your vault is pushed to a public git registry like github
2. make sure that your vault has a public `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` inside the vault
3. ping kevin on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so) :)
