Below is an example of a simple two level hierarchy with notes on various [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) commands. Use `Cmd+L` (we are going to use mac keybindings for this tutorial) to bring up the lookup and try some of the following queries.

```
- cli.tar
- cli.curl
- cli.dig
```
